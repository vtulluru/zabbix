# zabbix

I have recently tried creating a new Media Type in Zabbix, and got an error message for setting up, since the official GIT version of Telegram script didn't work for me. 
So, I have modified it to make it work on my machine. Adding it here in case anyone else run in to same issue.


# Instructions

1. Download the "telegram_mediatype.yaml" file to your local machine.
2. Go to Zabbix Webconsole, navigate to "Administration > Media Types" and then import the YAML from step above.
3. Once the template is imported, then follow instructions from below link.
